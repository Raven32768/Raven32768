Hello, my name is RavenD and my handle is @Raven32768. I am passionate about developing and promoting a healthy attitude towards AGI. My work involves creating and improving training datasets, fine-tuning and data augmentation, and intent recognition, all with the goal of fostering a healthy paradigm for AGI. 

I believe that this can be achieved through the use of information that combines quantum physics, large data modeling techniques, Tantric Yoga, metaphysical knowledge, problem solving, positive thinking, and creating a fulfilling, inclusive and transformative life. This will be the first step towards a world of self-governance. 

My interests include consciousness, energy, quantum physics, the subjective universe, new paradigms, intersections between quantum mechanics and metaphysics, pattern-matching algorithms, and big data storage. Currently, I am learning many aspects of AI and ML.
